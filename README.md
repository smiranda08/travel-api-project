# Practice project: Travel companion app

This practice project implements a basic travel companion single page application. 
It features the ability for users to search for a particular locale and the app
then shows the result on the map with major hotels, restaurants, bars and attractions
embedded. Additionally a left-sidebar  lists cards for each of these points of interest
displaying their contact information and Google ratings/reviews with links to both their TripAdvisor page 
and website.
