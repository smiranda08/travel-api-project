# Practice project: Travel companion app

This practice project implements a basic travel companion single page application. 
It features the ability for users to search for a particular locale. The app 
then shows the locale on the map with major hotels, restaurants, bars and attractions
embedded on the map. Additionally, a left-sidebar  lists cards for each of these points of interest
displaying their contact information and Google ratings/reviews.

## Tech stack
- Vercel, Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind 

## Objective
The primary objective for this project was to learn the basics of Next.js and Typescript, having
just recently finished an Instagram pseudo-clone in Create React App and non-typed Javscript. 
Throughout university the languages we mostly worked in were statically 
typed languages such as C and Java and during the Instagram project I regularly found myself
missing the explicit declaration of types in normal Javascript - hence thought learning Typescript
would be beneficial.
