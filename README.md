# Practice project: Travel companion app

This practice project implements a basic travel companion single page application. 
It features the ability for users to search for a particular locale. The app 
then shows the locale on the map with major hotels, restaurants, bars and attractions
embedded on the map. Additionally, a left-sidebar  lists cards for each of these points of interest
displaying their contact information and Google ratings/reviews.
